nectr: Non-parametric Exploratory Clustering with TURN-RES.
===========================================================

This is an R package including an implementation of the non-parametric clustering method authored by Foss, 2002. It was designed for industry analysts who need a fast way to explore a low dimension (p<10) dataset which does not impose a priori assumptions on the structure of the data.

Performance notes:
  + TURN-RES algorithm works fast and effectively. It may be slightly different to the paper mentioned above, due to a few somewhat opaque explanations at critical points. Nevertheless, I believe the principal is the same. Algorithm performance has only been analysed with respect to speed, and that only with a few datasets. The only notes I would add with regard to the quality of the clustering are that (a) The approximations made by quantizing and considering only distances parallel to the axes do seem to throw up some odd boundaries. (b) Bridges between clusters of similar density can easily be formed through noise. Unlike DBSCAN, we cannot tune by requiring a greater number of points to form the bridge. Unforunately this means that finding a 'best' parameter whether algorithmically or by inspection is generally impossible; by the time one has captured the clusters desired, bridges are formed, and many of the clusters will coalesce. While the paper showed good results with TURN-CUT to algorithmically choose the paramater, I have found real world data to be less accomodating, hence this algorithm has been dropped from the implementation.
  
  + Due to the speed of the algorithm weighed up against these issues, I have found the algorithm helpful in quickly exploring relationships in the data, particularly with the agglomeration schedule and parallel coordinate plots, but not in the final clustering. For this reason, I've implemented a (semi) quick-and-dirty EM Gaussian Clustering algorithm to construct the final clustering. It is much faster than most EM algorithms currently available in R, and will still chew through O(10^6) datasets quickly. However, this is currently under review, as after more extensive testing has yielded instances where cluster probabilities drop to 0 and some covariance matrices -> Inf in norm. Therefore the package is on hold while this algorithm is redesigned.
